		<h2>Intro and tutorial.</h3>
		<p>4th Dimension is a game where things are different from the 3rd dimension</br>
	  You have been sent to the 4th dimension, where everything is different.</br>
		There are portals, which some are bad and send you back, and some help you.</br>
		You also have to change directions in order to move to new places.</p>
		</br>
		<h3>Controls</h3>
		<p><h4>Player 1</h4></p>
		<p>Arrow keys to move</p>
		<p>Up arrow to jump</p>
		<p>1 and 2 to change directions</p>
		</br>
		<h3>What to see next</h3>
		<p>At the current moment, you're Xanax pills so expect 3D characters, most likely human.</br>
		You can also expect some new attacks like a gun attack in progress.</br>
		Maybe a map select and character select.</p>
