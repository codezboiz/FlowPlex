		<h2>Intro and tutorial.</h3>
		<p>Explorer's Realm is a strategy game that is still in a beta.</br>
		You are stuck in a strange dream that has set you in the past and</br>
		you need to survive. Move with the arrow keys and collect from the</br>
		areas that you have moved to. Go to the title screen and click tutorial</br>
		for more information</p>
		</br>
		<h3>What to see next</h3>
		<p>At the current moment you can only collect food and water (the only things</br>
		that are useful), but eventually you should see using wood and stone (not in the game</br>
		yet) to build stuff. You should also get a chance to see a bigger map and more areas.</p>
