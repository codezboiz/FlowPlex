		<h2>Intro and tutorial.</h3>
		<p>PolyBrawl is a Smash Bros Style game, but it tries to combine retro features with more realistic modern features.</br>
	  	You have sent to the 2nd dimension due to a mass explosion of the Earth, </br>
		and have to fight to the death, because only one person can be sent back</br>
		to the 3rd dimension.</p>

		<h2>History Of PolyBrawl</h2>
		
		<p style="font-size:18px;">
		<a href="https://playcanvas.com/"><strong><em>PolyBrawl</em></strong></a> started development way before it was named <strong><em>PolyBrawl</em></strong>. One of our friends named <strong>Paxton</strong> suggested <br> 
		<strong style="color:#cd78f5;">Sylis</strong> to make a game. It was going to be called <strong><em>Collide</strong></em> and was planned to be a first person shooter and you were <br> 
		able to go to different timelines. The project was ultimately scrapped for being to advanced for us back then. <br> 
		Since I <strong style="color:#2ea6fc;">(Ryan)</strong> wanted to code in <em>Ms. Barrier's</em> class more, I decided to use an unblocked website <br> 
		called <strong><em>PlayCanvas</em></strong>, which is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL"><strong>WebGL</strong></a> game engine. We created many new blank projects, <br> 
		but most of them were scrapped. <br><br>
		
		On <em>May 28, 2019</em>, we created a project called <strong><em>Bloodshed-Battle.</em></strong> It was supposed to include animations, <br> 
		but since none of us knew how to animate sprites in <strong><em>PlayCanvas</em></strong> that good, <br>
		we renamed it to <strong><em>PolyBrawl</em></strong>, so we could use simple sprites. The project's first beta <br> 
		was published right before  <em>Summer Break of 2019</em>. <br>
		<strong style="color:#cd78f5;">Sylis</strong> went to <strong>Vermont</strong>, while <strong style="color:#2ea6fc;">I</strong> went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh"><strong>Bangladesh</strong></a>. During My time there, <strong style="color:#2ea6fc;">I</strong> <br> continued to update <strong><em>PolyBrawl</em></strong>, <br>
		while <strong style="color:#cd78f5;">Sylis</strong> played Fortnite most of the Summer. It took about a month before the game <br> 
		looked somewhat complete, but the UI controls weren't the best <br> 
		(since <strong style="color:#2ea6fc;">I</strong> didn't really know how to use buttons at the time). <br>
		The gameplay was also still very basic, and collision had some bugs. (Those bugs were fixed in <br> 
		the latest build, but new ones appeared later). The earliest build from that time that's still intact is called: <br>
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<strong style="font-size:60px;">PolyBrawl BETA 1.6</strong>

		<!--Part 2-->
		<p style="font-size:18px;">
		<strong style="color:#2ea6fc;">I</strong> updated the game some more after that. When I came back, <strong style="color:#cd78f5;">Sylis</strong> started helping on the game. <br>
		Together, we added more to polybrawl. The UI navigation still stuck around until <em>January Of This Year</em>. It was <br> 
		updated to use buttons in the latest build. Although, this build from <em>September</em> <br>
		was when the game experimented with more new ideas. The <em>September of 2019</em> build was called:
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<strong style="font-size:60px;">PolyBrawl BETA 1.9.3</strong>

		</p>
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<!--Part 3-->
		<p style="font-size:18px;">
			We decided to re-create the <strong>UI Navigation</strong>, while creating the <em>Christmas Update</em>. <br> 
			We would release the <em>Christmas Update</em> with the <strong>Old UI Navigation</strong>, and the <strong>New</strong> <br> 
			<strong>UI Navigation</strong> with the <em>New Years Update</em>. <em>The Christmas Update</em> got corrupted, <br> 
			because of the <strong>New UI Navigation</strong> in an alternate scene. We decided, <br> 
			to cancel the <em>Christmas Update</em>, and we released the <em>New Years Update</em> <br> 
			exactly at </em>midnight</em> right when <em>the new year started</em>. This build <br> 
			is also one of the most recent, only being made a few months ago. The <em>New Years Update</em> was called:
